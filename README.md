WIC is a popular school in NSW. It has got branches in five different suburbs of Sydney and planning
to establish its branches in other states of Australia. The school is planning to have head office in
Sydney City Branch which is one among its branch in NSW. All the other branches will be under the
control of this Sydney City Branch.

The management decides to have the control of database in the head office, after a board meeting
with all the stakeholders of the school they are deciding to connect the entire schools database
through server and create a networking that connects the entire schools administration department.

Before they create a network to link the entire schools database, they have to start with building
application that can interact. To achieve this goal they are looking for an IT expert/company that can
help them achieve their goal.
